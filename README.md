# OCR and Speech Synthesis with Python

This Python script allows you to convert text from an image into spoken words using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Speech Synthesis. It utilizes the `pytesseract` library for OCR and the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library for speech synthesis.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pytesseract Pillow gTTS
Tesseract OCR: Download and install Tesseract OCR from the official Tesseract GitHub repository.
Usage
Customize the Script: Open the Python script and customize it according to your needs. Specifically, update the image_path variable with the path to the image you want to process.




Output: The program will extract text from the specified image and generate an audio file named output.mp3 with the spoken words.

Listen to the Spoken Words: You can listen to the spoken words by playing the output.mp3 file.


The script will perform OCR on the specified image and generate an audio file with the spoken words.
